# RENDEZVOUS

### 1. Functional Overview

**Rendezvous** is a mobile/web social networking platform designed to connect people based on their geographic location. It enables users to easily discover and join spontaneous social activities such as grabbing coffee, hanging out, or participating in any meetup within a specific time and place. The app emphasizes spontaneity and real-world interaction, helping users connect with others who share similar interests nearby.

**Main Objectives:**
- Allow users to create short-term meetup posts ("invitations") with location and images.
- Display active invitations within a nearby radius of the user.
- Provide simple interaction tools (like, dislike, join, comment) for each invitation.
- Support friend connections and privacy control for posts.
- Differentiate between Regular and Premium accounts with additional privileges.

#### Backend Responsibilities

This repository contains the **backend service** of Rendezvous.  
It is responsible for handling data, authentication, and API logic that powers the client applications.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Provide RESTful APIs for mobile/web clients.  
- Manage authentication (JWT-based) and user sessions.  
- Store and serve user data and posts via **MongoDB**.  
- Integrate **HERE Maps API** for geolocation and nearby post search.  
- Handle image upload and storage with **AWS S3**.  
- Manage friend requests, interactions, and notifications.  
- Expose API documentation through **Swagger UI** for easy testing.  

**Deployment:**
- The backend service is deployed on **Render Cloud Platform**.
- Live API base URL:
